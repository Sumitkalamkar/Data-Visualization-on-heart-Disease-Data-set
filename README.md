# Heart Disease Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on a heart disease dataset. The aim of the project is to analyze patterns and correlations in the data to better understand the factors contributing to heart disease.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
- Preprocessing the dataset.
- Analyzing demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors.
- Visualizing trends and correlations between features.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features such as:
- Patient demographics (e.g., age, gender).
- Clinical measurements (e.g., cholesterol levels, blood pressure).
- Lifestyle information (e.g., smoking habits, physical activity).

The dataset and project were originally hosted on Kaggle. You can find the Kaggle notebook and dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sumitkalamkar/notebook18f5b08caf/edit/run/197681447). 

## Tools and Libraries
The following Python libraries are utilized:
- `pandas` for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.
- Jupyter Notebook for an interactive analysis environment.

## Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Loading the Data**: Importing the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
3. **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarizing key statistics and metrics.
4. **Visual Exploration**: Using plots and charts to analyze feature relationships.
5. **Insights and Conclusions**: Identifying key patterns and summarizing findings.

## Visualizations
The project features:
- Distribution plots for understanding variable ranges.
- Heatmaps for visualizing correlations between features.
- Box plots for identifying outliers in clinical measurements.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-eda.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   cd heart-disease-eda
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run the notebook to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Results
The analysis provides:
- Insights into the distribution of heart disease cases.
- Key factors that correlate strongly with the presence of heart disease.
- Potential areas for further predictive modeling.

## Future Work
- Implement predictive models for heart disease classification.
- Extend the analysis to include external datasets for comparison.
- Investigate temporal trends if time-series data is available.
